# Time-Series-Forecasting---Sunspot-Data-Set
Sunspots are regions on the Sun's photosphere that appear darker than the surrounding areas on the visible solar disk due to reduced surface temperature associated with concentrations of magnetic field flux and intense magnetic activity on the Sun

**Packages Used :** 
numpy 
pandas 
matplotlib
matplotlib.pyplot 
seaborn
datetime 
parser 
statsmodels.tsa.stattools
pmdarima

# Steps involved
1) Importing the Libraries
2) Importing the Dataset
3) Feature engineering
4) Monthly Mean Total Sunspot
5) Lag plot
6) Co Relation Study
7) Testing the Stationarity of data
8) Forcasting
9) ARIMA
10) Train and Test


Summary : We have succesfully Forcasted the Sun Spot Pattern by using the Time SeriesÂ¶
